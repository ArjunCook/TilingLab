# TilingLab
Lab 4

This lab was by far the most frustrating. After having issues with the mapbox plugin, I downloaded both programs from the website and tried to use its remote API. The screenshot of the contribution package being incomplete is in this repository, and is the same one for the previous lab. Even after creating a new account, redownloading QGIS, deleting everything in the local folder, it still woulnd't work. I know none of these labs have been satisfactory work, but it has been very difficult figuring this out alone and away from UW.
